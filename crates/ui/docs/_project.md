## Project Plan

- Port existing UI to GPUI2
- Update UI in places that GPUI1 was limiting us*
- Understand the needs &/|| struggles the engineers have been having with building UI in the past and address as many of those as possible as we go
- Ship a simple, straightforward system with documentation that is easy to use to build UI

## Component Classification

To simplify the understanding of components and minimize unnecessary cognitive load, let's categorize components into two types:

- An element refers to a standalone component that doesn't import any other 'ui' components.
- A component indicates a component that utilizes or imports other 'ui' components.
